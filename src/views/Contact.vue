            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This project was programmed by me, Christian Stemmann, as part of the tailored training I did at the Hamburg Coding School.</p>
            <p>It is based on the idea of the final project of the HCS Full Stack Web Development course. It was originally meant to be a travel blog, but since I play in a band I decided to change it up a bit while keeping the technical requirements.</p>
            <p>The frontend is built with Vue and uses the Mapbox API. The backend uses node.js/Express and a MySQL database.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
