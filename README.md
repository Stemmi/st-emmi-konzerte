# St. Emmi Konzerte
A history of live shows of the rock band St. Emmi.
This is a project I do as a part of my training at the Hamburg Coding School.

## This is work in progress.

Proper documentation will follow...

## About

This project was programmed by me, Christian Stemmann, as part of the tailored training I did at the Hamburg Coding School.

It is based on the idea of the final project of the HCS Full Stack Web Development course. It was originally meant to be a travel blog, but since I play in a band I decided to change it up a bit while keeping the technical requirements.

The frontend is built with Vue and uses the Mapbox API. The backend uses node.js/Express and a MySQL database.

I hope you enjoy it!
